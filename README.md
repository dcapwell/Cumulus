Cumulus is a common collection of useful classes for developing server applications

Origin of the name
------------------

The name Cumulus came from the genus name of a low orbit cloud.  It was refereed to as "The cloud of choice for 6-yr.-olds" (http://nenes.eas.gatech.edu/Cloud/Clouds.pdf); this matches the design principles that this project is trying to achieve.  The project should be simple to use and not get in your way.
